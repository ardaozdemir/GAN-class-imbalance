# GAN-class-imbalance

In this project, SMOTE, a simple GAN, a second version of simple GAN, CTGAN, and GEGAN methods were used to solve to class imbalance problem
by creating new samples for the minority class. Their performance is evaluated by building SVM models and checking their accuracy and F1
scores. Also, the original and generated data were compared using t-SNE plots.

Data provided by the MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort (Filbin, Goldberg, Hacohen) with Olink Proteomics.
